Introduction
This API reference describes the RESTful, streaming, and realtime APIs you can use to interact with the OpenAI platform. REST APIs are usable via HTTP in any environment that supports HTTP requests. Language-specific SDKs are listed on the libraries page.

Authentication
The OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. Create, manage, and learn more about API keys in your organization settings.

Remember that your API key is a secret! Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). API keys should be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service on the server.

API keys should be provided via HTTP Bearer authentication.

Authorization: Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY
If you belong to multiple organizations or access projects through a legacy user API key, pass a header to specify which organization and project to use for an API request:

curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "OpenAI-Organization: YOUR_ORG_ID" \
  -H "OpenAI-Project: $PROJECT_ID"
Usage from these API requests counts as usage for the specified organization and project.Organization IDs can be found on your organization settings page. Project IDs can be found on your general settings page by selecting the specific project.

Debugging requests
In addition to error codes returned from API responses, you can inspect HTTP response headers containing the unique ID of a particular API request or information about rate limiting applied to your requests. Below is an incomplete list of HTTP headers returned with API responses:

API meta information

openai-organization: The organization associated with the request
openai-processing-ms: Time taken processing your API request
openai-version: REST API version used for this request (currently 2020-10-01)
x-request-id: Unique identifier for this API request (used in troubleshooting)
Rate limiting information

x-ratelimit-limit-requests
x-ratelimit-limit-tokens
x-ratelimit-remaining-requests
x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens
x-ratelimit-reset-requests
x-ratelimit-reset-tokens
OpenAI recommends logging request IDs in production deployments for more efficient troubleshooting with our support team, should the need arise. Our official SDKs provide a property on top-level response objects containing the value of the x-request-id header.

Backward compatibility
OpenAI is committed to providing stability to API users by avoiding breaking changes in major API versions whenever reasonably possible. This includes:

The REST API (currently v1)
Our first-party SDKs (released SDKs adhere to semantic versioning)
Model families (like gpt-4o or o1-mini)
Model prompting behavior between snapshots is subject to change. Model outputs are by their nature variable, so expect changes in prompting and model behavior between snapshots. For example, if you moved from gpt-4o-2024-05-13 to gpt-4o-2024-08-06, the same system or user messages could function differently between versions. The best way to ensure consistent prompting behavior and model output is to use pinned model versions, and to implement evals for your applications.

Backwards-compatible API changes:

Adding new resources (URLs) to the REST API and SDKs
Adding new optional API parameters
Adding new properties to JSON response objects or event data
Changing the order of properties in a JSON response object
Changing the length or format of opaque strings, like resource identifiers and UUIDs
Adding new event types (in either streaming or the Realtime API)
See the changelog for a list of backwards-compatible changes and rare breaking changes.

Responses
OpenAI's most advanced interface for generating model responses. Supports text and image inputs, and text outputs. Create stateful interactions with the model, using the output of previous responses as input. Extend the model's capabilities with built-in tools for file search, web search, computer use, and more. Allow the model access to external systems and data using function calling.

Create a model response
post
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
Creates a model response. Provide text or image inputs to generate text or JSON outputs. Have the model call your own custom code or use built-in tools like web search or file search to use your own data as input for the model's response.

Request body
input
string or array

Required
Text, image, or file inputs to the model, used to generate a response.

Learn more:

Text inputs and outputs
Image inputs
File inputs
Conversation state
Function calling

Show possible types
model
string

Required
Model ID used to generate the response, like gpt-4o or o1. OpenAI offers a wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and price points. Refer to the model guide to browse and compare available models.

include
array or null

Optional
Specify additional output data to include in the model response. Currently supported values are:

file_search_call.results: Include the search results of the file search tool call.
message.input_image.image_url: Include image urls from the input message.
computer_call_output.output.image_url: Include image urls from the computer call output.
instructions
string or null

Optional
Inserts a system (or developer) message as the first item in the model's context.

When using along with previous_response_id, the instructions from a previous response will not be carried over to the next response. This makes it simple to swap out system (or developer) messages in new responses.

max_output_tokens
integer or null

Optional
An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a response, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens.

metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

parallel_tool_calls
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to allow the model to run tool calls in parallel.

previous_response_id
string or null

Optional
The unique ID of the previous response to the model. Use this to create multi-turn conversations. Learn more about conversation state.

reasoning
object or null

Optional
o-series models only

Configuration options for reasoning models.


Show properties
store
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to store the generated model response for later retrieval via API.

stream
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using server-sent events. See the Streaming section below for more information.

temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

text
object

Optional
Configuration options for a text response from the model. Can be plain text or structured JSON data. Learn more:

Text inputs and outputs
Structured Outputs

Show properties
tool_choice
string or object

Optional
How the model should select which tool (or tools) to use when generating a response. See the tools parameter to see how to specify which tools the model can call.


Show possible types
tools
array

Optional
An array of tools the model may call while generating a response. You can specify which tool to use by setting the tool_choice parameter.

The two categories of tools you can provide the model are:

Built-in tools: Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend the model's capabilities, like web search or file search. Learn more about built-in tools.
Function calls (custom tools): Functions that are defined by you, enabling the model to call your own code. Learn more about function calling.

Show possible types
top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

truncation
string or null

Optional
Defaults to disabled
The truncation strategy to use for the model response.

auto: If the context of this response and previous ones exceeds the model's context window size, the model will truncate the response to fit the context window by dropping input items in the middle of the conversation.
disabled (default): If a model response will exceed the context window size for a model, the request will fail with a 400 error.
user
string

Optional
A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

Returns
Returns a Response object.

Starting a new project? We recommend trying Responses to take advantage of the latest OpenAI platform features. Compare Chat Completions with Responses.

Creates a model response for the given chat conversation. Learn more in the text generation, vision, and audio guides.

Parameter support can differ depending on the model used to generate the response, particularly for newer reasoning models. Parameters that are only supported for reasoning models are noted below. For the current state of unsupported parameters in reasoning models, refer to the reasoning guide.

Request body
messages
array

Required
A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. Depending on the model you use, different message types (modalities) are supported, like text, images, and audio.


Show possible types
model
string

Required
Model ID used to generate the response, like gpt-4o or o1. OpenAI offers a wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and price points. Refer to the model guide to browse and compare available models.

audio
object or null

Optional
Parameters for audio output. Required when audio output is requested with modalities: ["audio"]. Learn more.


Show properties
frequency_penalty
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

function_call
Deprecated
string or object

Optional
Deprecated in favor of tool_choice.

Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.

none means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message.

auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function.

Specifying a particular function via {"name": "my_function"} forces the model to call that function.

none is the default when no functions are present. auto is the default if functions are present.


Show possible types
functions
Deprecated
array

Optional
Deprecated in favor of tools.

A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.


Show properties
logit_bias
map

Optional
Defaults to null
Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

logprobs
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the content of message.

max_completion_tokens
integer or null

Optional
An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens.

max_tokens
Deprecated
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. This value can be used to control costs for text generated via API.

This value is now deprecated in favor of max_completion_tokens, and is not compatible with o1 series models.

metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

modalities
array or null

Optional
Output types that you would like the model to generate. Most models are capable of generating text, which is the default:

["text"]

The gpt-4o-audio-preview model can also be used to generate audio. To request that this model generate both text and audio responses, you can use:

["text", "audio"]

n
integer or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep n as 1 to minimize costs.

parallel_tool_calls
boolean

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

prediction
object

Optional
Configuration for a Predicted Output, which can greatly improve response times when large parts of the model response are known ahead of time. This is most common when you are regenerating a file with only minor changes to most of the content.


Show possible types
presence_penalty
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

reasoning_effort
string or null

Optional
Defaults to medium
o-series models only

Constrains effort on reasoning for reasoning models. Currently supported values are low, medium, and high. Reducing reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

response_format
object

Optional
An object specifying the format that the model must output.

Setting to { "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} } enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the Structured Outputs guide.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables the older JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using json_schema is preferred for models that support it.


Show possible types
seed
integer or null

Optional
This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the system_fingerprint response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

service_tier
string or null

Optional
Defaults to auto
Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.
When this parameter is set, the response body will include the service_tier utilized.

stop
string / array / null

Optional
Defaults to null
Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

store
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in our model distillation or evals products.

stream
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using server-sent events. See the Streaming section below for more information, along with the streaming responses guide for more information on how to handle the streaming events.

stream_options
object or null

Optional
Defaults to null
Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set stream: true.


Show properties
temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

tool_choice
string or object

Optional
Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. none means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message. auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. required means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}} forces the model to call that tool.

none is the default when no tools are present. auto is the default if tools are present.


Show possible types
tools
array

Optional
A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.


Show properties
top_logprobs
integer or null

Optional
An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. logprobs must be set to true if this parameter is used.

top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

user
string

Optional
A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

web_search_options
object

Optional
This tool searches the web for relevant results to use in a response. Learn more about the web search tool.


Show properties
Returns
Returns a chat completion object, or a streamed sequence of chat completion chunk objects if the request is streamed.

Session tokens
REST API endpoint to generate ephemeral session tokens for use in client-side applications.

Create session
post
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/sessions
Create an ephemeral API token for use in client-side applications with the Realtime API. Can be configured with the same session parameters as the session.update client event.

It responds with a session object, plus a client_secret key which contains a usable ephemeral API token that can be used to authenticate browser clients for the Realtime API.

Request body
input_audio_format
string

Optional
Defaults to pcm16
The format of input audio. Options are pcm16, g711_ulaw, or g711_alaw. For pcm16, input audio must be 16-bit PCM at a 24kHz sample rate, single channel (mono), and little-endian byte order.

input_audio_noise_reduction
object

Optional
Defaults to null
Configuration for input audio noise reduction. This can be set to null to turn off. Noise reduction filters audio added to the input audio buffer before it is sent to VAD and the model. Filtering the audio can improve VAD and turn detection accuracy (reducing false positives) and model performance by improving perception of the input audio.


Show properties
input_audio_transcription
object

Optional
Configuration for input audio transcription, defaults to off and can be set to null to turn off once on. Input audio transcription is not native to the model, since the model consumes audio directly. Transcription runs asynchronously through the /audio/transcriptions endpoint and should be treated as guidance of input audio content rather than precisely what the model heard. The client can optionally set the language and prompt for transcription, these offer additional guidance to the transcription service.


Show properties
instructions
string

Optional
The default system instructions (i.e. system message) prepended to model calls. This field allows the client to guide the model on desired responses. The model can be instructed on response content and format, (e.g. "be extremely succinct", "act friendly", "here are examples of good responses") and on audio behavior (e.g. "talk quickly", "inject emotion into your voice", "laugh frequently"). The instructions are not guaranteed to be followed by the model, but they provide guidance to the model on the desired behavior.

Note that the server sets default instructions which will be used if this field is not set and are visible in the session.created event at the start of the session.

max_response_output_tokens
integer or "inf"

Optional
Maximum number of output tokens for a single assistant response, inclusive of tool calls. Provide an integer between 1 and 4096 to limit output tokens, or inf for the maximum available tokens for a given model. Defaults to inf.

modalities
Optional
The set of modalities the model can respond with. To disable audio, set this to ["text"].

model
string

Optional
The Realtime model used for this session.

output_audio_format
string

Optional
Defaults to pcm16
The format of output audio. Options are pcm16, g711_ulaw, or g711_alaw. For pcm16, output audio is sampled at a rate of 24kHz.

temperature
number

Optional
Defaults to 0.8
Sampling temperature for the model, limited to [0.6, 1.2]. For audio models a temperature of 0.8 is highly recommended for best performance.

tool_choice
string

Optional
Defaults to auto
How the model chooses tools. Options are auto, none, required, or specify a function.

tools
array

Optional
Tools (functions) available to the model.


Show properties
turn_detection
object

Optional
Configuration for turn detection, ether Server VAD or Semantic VAD. This can be set to null to turn off, in which case the client must manually trigger model response. Server VAD means that the model will detect the start and end of speech based on audio volume and respond at the end of user speech. Semantic VAD is more advanced and uses a turn detection model (in conjuction with VAD) to semantically estimate whether the user has finished speaking, then dynamically sets a timeout based on this probability. For example, if user audio trails off with "uhhm", the model will score a low probability of turn end and wait longer for the user to continue speaking. This can be useful for more natural conversations, but may have a higher latency.


Show properties
voice
string

Optional
The voice the model uses to respond. Voice cannot be changed during the session once the model has responded with audio at least once. Current voice options are alloy, ash, ballad, coral, echo, fable, onyx, nova, sage, shimmer, and verse.

Returns

post
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/transcription_sessions
Create an ephemeral API token for use in client-side applications with the Realtime API specifically for realtime transcriptions. Can be configured with the same session parameters as the transcription_session.update client event.

It responds with a session object, plus a client_secret key which contains a usable ephemeral API token that can be used to authenticate browser clients for the Realtime API.

Request body
include
array

Optional
The set of items to include in the transcription. Current available items are:

null.

input_audio_format
string

Optional
Defaults to pcm16
The format of input audio. Options are pcm16, g711_ulaw, or g711_alaw. For pcm16, input audio must be 16-bit PCM at a 24kHz sample rate, single channel (mono), and little-endian byte order.

Configuration for input audio transcription, defaults to off and can be set to null to turn off once on. Input audio transcription is not native to the model, since the model consumes audio directly. Transcription runs asynchronously through Whisper and should be treated as rough guidance rather than the representation understood by the model.


Show properties
instructions
string

The default system instructions (i.e. system message) prepended to model calls. This field allows the client to guide the model on desired responses. The model can be instructed on response content and format, (e.g. "be extremely succinct", "act friendly", "here are examples of good responses") and on audio behavior (e.g. "talk quickly", "inject emotion into your voice", "laugh frequently"). The instructions are not guaranteed to be followed by the model, but they provide guidance to the model on the desired behavior.

Note that the server sets default instructions which will be used if this field is not set and are visible in the session.created event at the start of the session.

max_response_output_tokens
integer or "inf"

Maximum number of output tokens for a single assistant response, inclusive of tool calls. Provide an integer between 1 and 4096 to limit output tokens, or inf for the maximum available tokens for a given model. Defaults to inf.

modalities
The set of modalities the model can respond with. To disable audio, set this to ["text"].

output_audio_format
string

The format of output audio. Options are pcm16, g711_ulaw, or g711_alaw.

temperature
number

Sampling temperature for the model, limited to [0.6, 1.2]. Defaults to 0.8.

tool_choice
string

How the model chooses tools. Options are auto, none, required, or specify a function.

tools
array

Tools (functions) available to the model.


Show properties
turn_detection
object

Configuration for turn detection. Can be set to null to turn off. Server VAD means that the model will detect the start and end of speech based on audio volume and respond at the end of user speech.


Show properties
voice
string

The voice the model uses to respond. Voice cannot be changed during the session once the model has responded with audio at least once. Current voice options are alloy, ash, ballad, coral, echo sage, shimmer and verse.

Client events
These are events that the OpenAI Realtime WebSocket server will accept from the client.

session.update
Send this event to update the session’s default configuration. The client may send this event at any time to update any field, except for voice. However, note that once a session has been initialized with a particular model, it can’t be changed to another model using session.update.

When the server receives a session.update, it will respond with a session.updated event showing the full, effective configuration. Only the fields that are present are updated. To clear a field like instructions, pass an empty string.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

        "max_response_output_tokens": "inf"
    }
}
input_audio_buffer.append
Send this event to append audio bytes to the input audio buffer. The audio buffer is temporary storage you can write to and later commit. In Server VAD mode, the audio buffer is used to detect speech and the server will decide when to commit. When Server VAD is disabled, you must commit the audio buffer manually.

The client may choose how much audio to place in each event up to a maximum of 15 MiB, for example streaming smaller chunks from the client may allow the VAD to be more responsive. Unlike made other client events, the server will not send a confirmation response to this event.

audio
string

Base64-encoded audio bytes. This must be in the format specified by the input_audio_format field in the session configuration.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

type
string

The event type, must be input_audio_buffer.append.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.append
{
    "event_id": "event_456",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.append",
    "audio": "Base64EncodedAudioData"
}
input_audio_buffer.commit
Send this event to commit the user input audio buffer, which will create a new user message item in the conversation. This event will produce an error if the input audio buffer is empty. When in Server VAD mode, the client does not need to send this event, the server will commit the audio buffer automatically.

Committing the input audio buffer will trigger input audio transcription (if enabled in session configuration), but it will not create a response from the model. The server will respond with an input_audio_buffer.committed event.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

string

The event type, must be input_audio_buffer.commit.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.commit
{
    "event_id": "event_789",

}
input_audio_buffer.clear
Send this event to clear the audio bytes in the buffer. The server will respond with an input_audio_buffer.cleared event.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

type
string

The event type, must be input_audio_buffer.clear.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.clear
{
    "event_id": "event_012",

}
conversation.item.create
Add a new Item to the Conversation's context, including messages, function calls, and function call responses. This event can be used both to populate a "history" of the conversation and to add new items mid-stream, but has the current limitation that it cannot populate assistant audio messages.

If successful, the server will respond with a conversation.item.created event, otherwise an error event will be sent.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

item
object

The item to add to the conversation.


Show properties
previous_item_id
string

The ID of the preceding item after which the new item will be inserted. If not set, the new item will be appended to the end of the conversation. If set to root, the new item will be added to the beginning of the conversation. If set to an existing ID, it allows an item to be inserted mid-conversation. If the ID cannot be found, an error will be returned and the item will not be added.

type
string

The event type, must be conversation.item.create.

OBJECT conversation.item.create

            }
        ]
    }
}
conversation.item.truncate
Send this event to truncate a previous assistant message’s audio. The server will produce audio faster than realtime, so this event is useful when the user interrupts to truncate audio that has already been sent to the client but not yet played. This will synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with the client's playback.

Truncating audio will delete the server-side text transcript to ensure there is not text in the context that hasn't been heard by the user.

If successful, the server will respond with a conversation.item.truncated event.

audio_end_ms
integer

Inclusive duration up to which audio is truncated, in milliseconds. If the audio_end_ms is greater than the actual audio duration, the server will respond with an error.

content_index
integer

The index of the content part to truncate. Set this to 0.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

item_id
string

The ID of the assistant message item to truncate. Only assistant message items can be truncated.

conversation.item.delete
Send this event when you want to remove any item from the conversation history. The server will respond with a conversation.item.deleted event, unless the item does not exist in the conversation history, in which case the server will respond with an error.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

item_id

}
response.create
This event instructs the server to create a Response, which means triggering model inference. When in Server VAD mode, the server will create Responses automatically.

A Response will include at least one Item, and may have two, in which case the second will be a function call. These Items will be appended to the conversation history.

The server will respond with a response.created event, events for Items and content created, and finally a response.done event to indicate the Response is complete.

The response.create event includes inference configuration like instructions, and temperature. These fields will override the Session's configuration for this Response only.

event_id

The server is generating a Response, which if successful will produce either one or two Items, which will be of type message (role assistant) or type function_call.
The input audio buffer has been committed, either by the client or the server (in server_vad mode). The server will take the content of the input audio buffer and add it to a new user message Item.

conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed
This event is the output of audio transcription for user audio written to the user audio buffer. Transcription begins when the input audio buffer is committed by the client or server (in server_vad mode). Transcription runs asynchronously with Response creation, so this event may come before or after the Response events.

Realtime API models accept audio natively, and thus input transcription is a separate process run on a separate ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model, currently always whisper-1. Thus the transcript may diverge somewhat from the model's interpretation, and should be treated as a rough guide.

}
input_audio_buffer.committed
Returned when an input audio buffer is committed, either by the client or automatically in server VAD mode. The item_id property is the ID of the user message item that will be created, thus a conversation.item.created event will also be sent to the client.

event_id
string

The unique ID of the server event.

item_id
string

The ID of the user message item that will be created.

previous_item_id
string

The ID of the preceding item after which the new item will be inserted.

}
input_audio_buffer.speech_started
Sent by the server when in server_vad mode to indicate that speech has been detected in the audio buffer. This can happen any time audio is added to the buffer (unless speech is already detected). The client may want to use this event to interrupt audio playback or provide visual feedback to the user.

The client should expect to receive a input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped event when speech stops. The item_id property is the ID of the user message item that will be created when speech stops and will also be included in the input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped event (unless the client manually commits the audio buffer during VAD activation).

audio_start_ms
integer

Milliseconds from the start of all audio written to the buffer during the session when speech was first detected. This will correspond to the beginning of audio sent to the model, and thus includes the prefix_padding_ms configured in the Session.

event_id
string

The unique ID of the server event.

item_id
string

The ID of the user message item that will be created when speech stops.

}
input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped
Returned in server_vad mode when the server detects the end of speech in the audio buffer. The server will also send an conversation.item.created event with the user message item that is created from the audio buffer.

audio_end_ms
integer

Milliseconds since the session started when speech stopped. This will correspond to the end of audio sent to the model, and thus includes the min_silence_duration_ms configured in the Session.

event_id
string

The unique ID of the server event.

item_id
string

The ID of the user message item that will be created.

Request body
input
string

Required
The text to generate audio for. The maximum length is 4096 characters.

model
string

Required
One of the available TTS models: tts-1, tts-1-hd or gpt-4o-mini-tts.

voice
string

Required
The voice to use when generating the audio. Supported voices are alloy, ash, ballad, coral, echo, fable, onyx, nova, sage, shimmer, and verse. Previews of the voices are available in the Text to speech guide.

instructions
string

Optional
Control the voice of your generated audio with additional instructions. Does not work with tts-1 or tts-1-hd.

response_format
string

Optional
Defaults to mp3
The format to audio in. Supported formats are mp3, opus, aac, flac, wav, and pcm.

speed
number

Optional
Defaults to 1
The speed of the generated audio. Select a value from 0.25 to 4.0. 1.0 is the default.

Returns
The audio file content.

Example request

Create transcription
post
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions
Transcribes audio into the input language.

Request body
file
file

Required
The audio file object (not file name) to transcribe, in one of these formats: flac, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, ogg, wav, or webm.

model
string

Required
ID of the model to use. The options are gpt-4o-transcribe, gpt-4o-mini-transcribe, and whisper-1 (which is powered by our open source Whisper V2 model).

include[]
array

Optional
Additional information to include in the transcription response. logprobs will return the log probabilities of the tokens in the response to understand the model's confidence in the transcription. logprobs only works with response_format set to json and only with the models gpt-4o-transcribe and gpt-4o-mini-transcribe.

language
string

Optional
The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 (e.g. en) format will improve accuracy and latency.

prompt
string

Optional
An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment. The prompt should match the audio language.

response_format
string

Optional
Defaults to json
The format of the output, in one of these options: json, text, srt, verbose_json, or vtt. For gpt-4o-transcribe and gpt-4o-mini-transcribe, the only supported format is json.

stream
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using server-sent events. See the Streaming section of the Speech-to-Text guide for more information.

Note: Streaming is not supported for the whisper-1 model and will be ignored.

temperature
number

Optional
Defaults to 0
The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use log probability to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.

timestamp_granularities[]
array

Optional
Defaults to segment
The timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. response_format must be set verbose_json to use timestamp granularities. Either or both of these options are supported: word, or segment. Note: There is no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency.

Returns
The transcription object, a verbose transcription object or a stream of transcript events.
